## variation when things are growing

two things are relevant here

how does various

techniuque for when an environmental variable explains some of the yearly variation. Do we want to include that variable effect in our model of the outcome

or do you just want to calculate the average, expected every year, and then add in the missing year effects

This assumes that every year you measure comes from the same statistical population.

Could you ever have something lie the *variance* amon years being a funciton of the yearly annual rainfall in each year. e.g. because in wetter years the unmeasured factors that lead to increased variation are stronger. that would be very interesting.

could you even model rainfall, as having a mean and variance each year, and then modelling missing variables as functions of the observed population mean and varance of *rain*

or would you use rain information to calculate the expected yearly averages based on *rainfall* (N-YEAR long) and then to them add the differences among years, as before? no different from adding to an intercept.

## Backing up

all this is based on an arguement based on an idea I want to test and the testing is probably goin to be its own post.

how to model growth when there are missing years? especially in the case where different individuals are different in size, but

## how to work with measurement error in intital age

in roos, and I suppose in many animals, we don't know the actual original age. researchers have this approach to use, which is based on a simple linear model, an OLS by which the first measurement of size is used to infer an age in months or years. I'm not exactly sure of the units.

So what we have is a distribution, not on starting size, but on age at first measurment. we get an informative prior, by combining the parameters in the formula for starting size, then using that later in the subsequent equations.. does that make sense?

We don't need the starting size for anything other than making the line.. I guess, until age becomes a part of the equation.

when age is a part of what we're doing, the we have of course no idea of the roo's acutal, objective age, and so we -- that is, its absolute age! so it is uncertain, since we propagate the age at first measurement.

increasing levels of model complexity:

-   one discrete-time model (done already in a different post)
-   yearly variation in the discrete model -- among many individuals, each with the same growth rate otherwise
-   among-individual variation in the growth rate
-   among-individual variation AND between-year variation
-   the years are not the same -- more years, but the same number covered per individual
-   missing years (but no year missing all individuals )
-   some years missing all individuals, different sizes of missing year
