## What is this post

This post is meant to be a simple template for new posts -- when I make a new post I'll start by copying and pasting this current one over. Probably in the future there will be a plugin that does this for us, but until then this will be fine.

## Why I switched to Quarto

A simple and frequent answer: overenthusiasm! I like seeing all the new things that the Rstudio team develop, and I know that this vibrant community will keep adding features and tutorials

I'm also using [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets). Here are some observations on that so far:

-   `Last error: ! System command 'quarto' failed` I get this error message more that 10x more often than any other. As I'm learning Quarto I keep making errors which break the Quarto process but `targets` doesn't (yet?) communicate the specific error message. To find out what has gone wrong, I go over to the terminal and run `quarto render .`

-   you have to go into `_metadata.yml` and stop the posts from freezing, by setting `freeze: false` . Targets will handle all the rest of it.

I'm using `targets` with quarto because I want to work with large bayesian models fit with `stan` and `brms`., and fitting them in a regular blog post -- including compiling, sampling etc.

## My own observations and questions

so far it is very straightforward!

-   \~it seems like post folder cant begin with dates?\~ you *can* start a folder with a date, and I do, so that the posts sort in at least approximately the right temporal sequence. However the date for a post comes from the YAML, not the folder name.

-   love LOVE the bibliography automatically appearing
