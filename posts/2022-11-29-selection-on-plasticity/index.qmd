## Model for measuring selection directly:



```{r}
true_corr_plasticity_avg <- .7
sd_avg <- .9
sd_plasticity <- .3
n_females <- 47

corrmat <- matrix(c(1, true_corr_plasticity_avg, true_corr_plasticity_avg, 1),
       byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2)

var_covar <- diag(c(sd_avg, sd_plasticity)) %*% corrmat %*% diag(c(sd_avg, sd_plasticity))

female_avg_and_plasticity <- MASS::mvrnorm(
  n = n_females,
  mu = c(0,0),
  Sigma = var_covar)

```

We have the average and the slope for each female. 

For a bit of extra realism, lets simulate several years and let the females belong to different cohorts. 
for simplicity, lets say each female lives for 

```{r}
twenty_years_environment <- runif(20, min = -3, max = 3)

female_start_years <- sample(1:16, size = n_females, replace = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

df <- tibble(
  female_id = rep(1:n_females, each = 4),
  year_id = rep(female_start_years, each = 4) + 0:3,
  env = twenty_years_environment[year_id]
)

df$env |> mean()

```
