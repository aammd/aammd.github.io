## What is this post

There's a concise and optimized hierarchical model described in the Stan manual. I would like to understand it in its Final Form as much as possible. 
So here I want to write out the stan code, simulate from the model (using Stan and R) and fit it to recover parameters.

## The model

This model is described in detail [in the Stan user's manual](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/multivariate-hierarchical-priors.html)
