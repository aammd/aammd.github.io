Probably in the future there will be a plugin that does this for us, but until then this will be fine.\n\n## Why I switched to Quarto\n\nA simple and frequent answer: overenthusiasm! I like seeing all the new things that the ~~Rstudio~~ Posit team develop, and I know that the vibrant R community  community will keep adding features and tutorials\n\n## quarto resources\n\n-   [the Ultimate Guide to starting a Quarto blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.htm)\n\n-   [quarto discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions)\n\n-   [Danielle Navarro's comments on the topic](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/)\n\n-   [Nick Tierney's notes](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2022/04/11/rmd-to-qmd/)\n\n-   and of course [Nicks exciting book project!](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/)\n\n## surprise it's targets\n\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/12yB3XoYboAkjm\" width=\"480\" height=\"273\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nBelow I describe my attempt to start a whole-blog workflow using `targets`. \nHowever, this got unwieldly very fast! \nMy new plan is to use a targets workflow on a post-by-post basis, using \n:::\n\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/disney-2016-new-year-the-emperors-groove-12yB3XoYboAkjm\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n\nI'm also using [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets). Here are some observations on that so far:\n\n-   `Last error: ! System command 'quarto' failed` I get this error message more that 10x more often than any other. As I'm learning Quarto I keep making errors which break the Quarto process but `targets` doesn't (yet?) communicate the specific error message. To find out what has gone wrong, I go over to the terminal and run `quarto render .`\n\n-   you have to go into `_metadata.yml` and stop the posts from freezing, by setting `freeze: false` . Targets will handle all the rest of it.\n\nI'm using `targets` with quarto because I want to work with large bayesian models fit with `stan` and `brms`., and fitting them in a regular blog post -- including compiling, sampling etc.\n\n## My own observations and questions\n\nso far it is very straightforward!\n\n-   ~~it seems like post folder cant begin with dates?~~ you *can* start a folder with a date, and I do, so that the posts sort in at least approximately the right temporal sequence. However the date for a post comes from the YAML, not the folder name.\n\n-   love LOVE the bibliography automatically appearing\n\n-   DO think about changing the working directory for chunk evaluations to the project root, [as described here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/working-directory.html). This is really important because that is the directory that `targets` uses when sourcing files. For example `tar_load(my_target_name)` will load in an object from your pipeline. But run this same line from an `.qmd` file in a subfolder (say `posts/yourpostname/index.qmd`), then THAT will be the location the computer looks in..\n",
