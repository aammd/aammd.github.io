The twist is that the latent variable is a probability, and I want to know if it makes a difference to model it on the logit or the probability scale. \n\nHere \"makes a difference\" means either that the answer is different, or that the algorithm works differently.\n\n### Sex ratio an dimorphism\n\nsuppose we are asking across many species, does a more biased sex ratio mean a greater difference in size between sexes?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnspp <- 25\n\nn_indiv <- rpois(25, 20)\n\nsex_ratios <- rbeta(nspp, 10,5)\n\nse\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError: object 'se' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
