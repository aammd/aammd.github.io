What proportion of total variance can be assigned to genotype? \n\n## The design\n\nA large number of genotypes are chosen, three replicates per genotype. \nEach plant grown alone and is \"inoculated\" with two aphid nymphs. \nAt the end of **2 weeks** we count all the aphids, and model growth rate by the classic exponential \n\n$$\ny \\sim \\text{Poisson}(2e^{rt})\n$$\nand using 2 for the time parameter to get the weekly population growth rate. \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n### Poisson or?\nI feel like there are probably multiple ways to model the observation error of population growth, and Poisson is only one. EC Pielou gives another in her book, deriving a distribution for the population size of a growing population that is based on the Binomial distribution. Here I'm going with Poisson, but another post could explore another technique! \n:::\n\n## The problem\n\nAt the end of the experiment, we see that there are a suprisingly large number of zeros -- some plants have no aphids on them! \nAnd there's another surprising detail: when we calculate the mean and variance of aphid population size for each genotype, we find they have a _negative_ relationship. This is surprising because normally when the average of a count is high, the variance is higher too! \n\nWhat's going on?\n\n## The probability of death-by-experimenter ( $m$ )\n\nMaybe the aphids don't survive transfer to the host plant at the start. After all, in order to maximize the impact of the host plant on the female, the experimenters started them at as early an age as possible. \nI'll say that the probability of being killed in transfer is $m$. That means that by the time the aphids start reproducing, the plants can be put in three categories in three proportions:\n\n* $m^2$ plants have no aphids (both died)\n* $2m(1-m)$ plants have ONE aphid\n* $(1-m)^2$ plants have both aphids \n\nRight away, that suggests a sort of artisanal mixture model for the aphid population sizes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Pr}(Y=0|m,r) &\\sim m^2 + 2m(1-m)\\times\\text{Poisson}(0|e^{rt}) + (1-m)^2\\times\\text{Poisson}(0|2e^{rt}) \\\\\n\\text{Pr}(Y=y|m,r) &\\sim 2m(1-m)\\times\\text{Poisson}(y|e^{rt}) + (1-m)^2\\times\\text{Poisson}(y|2e^{rt}) \\\\\nm &\\sim \\text{Beta}(2,5) \\\\\nr &\\sim \\text{Normal}(1.5, 2) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nI guess you could call this a \"zero-inflated mixture of Poissons\".\nBut the name doesn't matter as much, what is interesting it that it follows logically from the experimental situation described. \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## some observations about this model \n\n* I feel like this notation (and the model code) would be \"tighter\" if you replace $Pois(0|e^{rt})$ with the probability of zero in a poisson distribution: $e^{-\\lambda}$ which in this case would be $e^{-e^{rt}}. But I also think that would make the model less readable, which is a BAD thing!\n* We decided to use a Normal prior for r since it is possible to be both negative or positive. Most of the prior probability in _this_ model is positive, though, because these animals are supposed to do well on these plants!\n* I suppose you could give $m$ a logit link and model it as caused by different factors, such as the experimenter who transferred the immature insects at the start, or maybe even something about the host plants. However, here we're treating it as a constant!\n:::\n\n## Simulation study: identical hosts\n\nThe goal is the same as always: simulate the data-generating process and see if models can fit it! I try lots of things here, and eventually build up to fitting and testing the model i just described in a Stan program, and then in a brms workflow.\n\n### Exponential growth, no mortality: simplest model\n\nHere is a simple model of exponential population growth with poisson variation, just to confirm it works as I thought it would\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{abd} &\\sim \\text{Poisson}(N_0e^{rt}) \\\\\nr &\\sim \\text{Normal}(1.5,.2)  \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIn all the stan code that follows, you'll see that I've written this on the log scale. I have a few reasons for doing this.\nOne is that population growth rates are usually modelled as a log ratio, so this keeps the code looking more like the R scripts used for this kind of problem. \nAnother is that this is a [parameterization of the Poisson available in Stan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/unbounded_discrete_distributions.html#poisson-distribution-log-parameterization), which is a bit more efficient \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{abd} &\\sim \\text{PoissonLog}(\\ln{N_0} + rt) \\\\\nr &\\sim \\text{Normal}(1.5,.2)  \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nHere is a simulated dataset for plenty of replicate clones: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrep <- 300\n\nr <- log(6)\n\naphid_data <- expand_grid(rep_id = 1:nrep, first_aphid = 1:2) |>\n  # expected aphids per aphid (No = 1)\n mutate(expect_aphids = 1*exp(r*2),\n        obs_aphids = rpois(n = length(expect_aphids), lambda = expect_aphids))\n\n# combine the two aphids per plant\naphid_data_sum <- aphid_data |> \n  group_by(rep_id) |> \n  summarize(obs_aphids = sum(obs_aphids))\n\nggplot(aphid_data_sum, aes(x = obs_aphids)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
