There are many popular ways of describing this relationship; one very common and convenient relationship is the Von-Bertanalaffy (VB) growth curve:\n\n$$\nL_t = L_0e^{-rt} + L_\\infty(1 - e^{-rt})\n$$ {#eq-vb}\n\nThis can also be written as\n\n$$\nL_t = L_\\infty - (L_\\infty - L_0)e^{-rt}\n$$\n\nThis curve has a long tradition in ecology. It can be derived from simple assumptions about how different aspects of metabolism scale with the body size of an organism. I'm not going to derive it here because I don't want this to be a huge post!\n\nI like this second way of writing the equation because it highlights that the VB equation is a linear transformation of an exponential function. We start out at $L_0$ and exponentially decay towards $L_\\infty$.\n\n## a single tree\n\nI'm going to do a simple simulation of one tree growing. here is code that does that\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntar_load(vb_one_tree)\n\nvb_one_tree |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Lt_obs)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y = Lt)) + \n  theme_bw()\n```\n:::\n\n\nsimulate this same data in targets\n\nfit a stan model to it! here is the Stan model: formatted?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvb_one_tree <- cmdstan_model(here::here(\"posts\", \"2022-10-14-growth_curve_measurement_error\",\"vb_one_tree.stan\"))\n\nsource(here::here(\"posts\", \"2022-10-14-growth_curve_measurement_error\",\"vb-growth.R\"))\n\none_tree_sim <- sim_vb_one_tree()\n\none_tree_list <- list(n = nrow(one_tree_sim),\n                      time  = one_tree_sim$time, \n                      Lt = one_tree_sim$Lt_obs)\n\none_tree_post <- vb_one_tree$sample(data = one_tree_list,\n                                    refresh = 0L,\n                                    parallel_chains = 4)\n\none_tree_post\n```\n:::\n\n\nplot it\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n\nexpected_df <- one_tree_post |> \n  spread_rvars(Lmax, r) |> \n  expand_grid(time = seq(0, 200, length.out = 14)) |> \n  mutate(Lt = Lmax * (1 - exp(-r * time)))\n\nexpected_plot <- expected_df |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = time, ydist = Lt)) + \n  stat_lineribbon()\nexpected_plot\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis relationship shows the *average* line, the expected size of the tree.

We do this by modelling the starting size as a parameter in the model\n\nHere we kind of have two choices. We could subtract every trees first date of measurment from all measurements. This would start all trees off at 0. And then the likelihood for $L_1$ would be:\n\n$$ \nL_1 \\sim \\text{N}(L_0e^{-r0} + L_\\infty(1 - e^{-r0}), \\sigma_{obs})\n$$\n\nOr, we could split the likelihood into two parts: one for the first observations, and one for all subsequent ones:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nL_t &\\sim \\text{N}(L_oe^{-rt} + L_\\infty(1 - e^{-rt}), \\sigma_{obs}) \\\\\nL_1 &\\sim \\text{N}(L_o, \\sigma_{obs})\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIf we don't know the size that the tree was at the beginning\n\n-   create a new target to run tidybayes on both of these and extract them. look at the distributions of Lo.\n\n-   think about how to work with differing growth rates across years -- taylor approx?\n\n-   make a multi-individual version where everyone has a different Lo parameter -- just using indexing\n\n-   make a multi-site version where everyone has a site offset too\n\n-   can you do it like\n\nvector_of_plot_id -- as long as numbers of trees, having values up to the max plot id vector_of_plot_ids\\[tree_id\\] -- get the plot that a specific tree is in\n\nvector_of_plot_means\\[vector_of_plot_ids\\[tree_id\\]\\] vector_of_plot_sigmas\\[vector_of_plot_ids\\[tree_id\\]\\]\n\nas the two parameters for the distribution of all tree IDs\n\nthen to calculate the Lo for a new tree you'd use these latter mean and sigma for that plot or whatever model you ahve\n\nhow to add yearly variation?\n\nr is a year interval\n\nwould it be possible to find the expectation of a range of values from a gaussian process?\n\nwhat would be the expectation of a t draws from a normal distribution? like every year, some are up and some are down -- have any of those years been observed already.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntar_load(growth_curve_predict_mcmc_vb_one_tree_Lo_oneline_predictions)\ntar_load(growth_curve_predict_data)\n\ngrowth_curve_predict_mcmc_vb_one_tree_Lo_oneline_predictions |> \n  gather_rvars(Lnew[t_id]) |> \n  mutate(time = growth_curve_predict_data$timenew[t_id]) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = time, dist = .value)) + \n  stat_dist_lineribbon()\n```\n:::\n\n\nIs it as simple as: a generated quantites model which takes the new observations, models them as N(lo, sigma_obs), then computes the expectation as a generated quantity?\n",
