I would like to understand it in its Final Form as much as possible. So here I want to write out the stan code, simulate from the model (using Stan and R) and fit it to recover parameters.\n\n## The model\n\nThis model is described in detail [in the Stan user's manual](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/multivariate-hierarchical-priors.html)\n",
