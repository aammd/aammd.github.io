    "text": "continued fractions\nContinued Fractions look like this:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{d_1 + \\frac{n_2}{d_2 + \\frac{n_3}{d_3 + \\cdots } } }\n\\]\nand have an infinite number of \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) values. However, if after \\(k\\) values you just replace the remaining ones (the \\(...\\) above) with 0, then you get a k-term finite continued fraction, which is maybe close enough:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{d_1  + \\frac{n_2}{\\ddots + \\frac{n_k}{d_k}}}\n\\]\nContinued fractions have the values of \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) defined by a series. We need a function that will take the series for the numerator and denominator, calculate \\(k\\) terms, and put them together into a continued fraction.\nSo, how do we calculate this in R? Well, it turns out we can apply two concepts we learned from Wickham’s book to do so: closures and functionals.\n\nCreating a series of closures\nWe could say that each “part” of the continued fraction was a unit that looks like\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{d + x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) are a “pair” of numerator and denominator, and \\(x\\) is the next “part”, and so on. (there are probably mathematical terms for these, but I’m an ecologist, not a mathematician!). If you “build” the continued fraction from the inside out, you’d start with \\(x = 0\\), and calculate \\(\\frac{n_k}{d_k}\\). Then you move on to \\(n_{k-1}\\); for this fraction you have the numerator-denominator pair, plus the term (\\(x\\)) which you just calculated.\nWe can use closures to calculate each of these “parts” in turn, in order to keep the numerator-denominator pairs together. Closures are functions which are created by other functions; they “enclose” the environment in which they were created (hence the name), which means they can use variables from that environment (in our case, the values of a numerator & denominator)\nFirst, we make a “function factory”, a function which creates other functions (closures which retain different values of \\(n\\) and \\(d\\)):\n\nfrac_maker <- function(n, d){\n  force(n)\n  force(d)\n  function(x) n / (d + x)\n  }\n\nThis function takes a pair of numbers and defines a new function which uses them. But how can we create lots of closures, one for every numerator-denominator “pair” between 1 and \\(k\\)? We can use the function Map to run this function on each variable pair. Map works like a zipper, combining the first elements of two (or more) vectors with a function, then the second, etc. For example, the reciprocal of the Golden Ratio is the result of a continued fraction where \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) are both 1:\n\n  Ns <- rep(1, 20)\n  Ds <- rep(1, 20)\n  funs <- Map(frac_maker, Ns, Ds)\n\nfuns is now a list of functions, each one remembering its own particular value of \\(n\\) or \\(d\\). Now all we need to do is put them together and run them all. For that, we need another functional: Reduce."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I want to tell you about an approach for functional programming in R – and then apply it to studying population growth!\nI have been studying some of the purrr functions lately. They are a useful family of functions for performing two common tasks in R: manipulating lists and altering the behaviour of functions. If you’d like a high-quality guide to this group of functions, set aside some time to work through Jenny Bryan’s excellent tutorial and Hadley Wickham’s chapter on Lists.\nI was inspired to write this post after reading This StackOverflow question by jebyrnes. He asks:\nand there is! An answerer mentioned purr::accumulate(). In this post I’m going to expand on the approach they suggest. accumulate, and its twin reduce, are examples of functionals – functions that take functions as their arguments, and manipulate their behaviour in some way. purrr::accumulate is a wrapper around to Reduce from the base package, with the argument accumulate = TRUE.\naccumulate is normally used when you want to do some cumulative function all along a vector. For example, we can reproduce the cumulative some of a vector like this (same output as cumsum(1:10))\n.x and .y here are just a handy way of writing “the first thing” and “the second thing”. Then accumulate goes down the vector 1:10, and takes the first thing (1) adds it to the second thing (2) and so on….\nHowever, this is not the only way it works! accumulate can take an initial value (.init) and can work on a dummy variable. If its starting function does nothing but modify an element, it will just keep modifying it: so instead of f(1, 2), f(f(1, 2), 3) we get f(.init), f(f(.init)) etc:\nClearly, the 0s are not involved in any calculation (the answer would be 0!). instead, you just get the starting value multiplied by 1.5 each time!\nThis already suggests an awesome biological interpretation: logistic population growth.\nOn thing I like about this is that is is to much easier to look at – it look like the common biological equation for population growth:\n\\[\nN_{t+1} = r*N_t\n\\]"

Perhaps a for loop emphasizes the passage of time – how, at each time step (each i for example) certain things happen in a certain order (the Resource grows, the Predator kills some, then some predators die, etc). On the other hand, I feel like the functional programming approach emphasizes how a population (or pair of populations) is transformed. Each little function has some parameters – which are either, constant, varying, and/or influenced by something besides population size – and each little function does only one thing – transform the population between one time step and the next."

They eat prey faster when there is more prey – though they do have to slow down to catch, kill, and chew.1\nIf a predator can eat multiple things, then they might end up eating less of any one prey because they spread their kills around among all their prey. In the very simplest case, they do this in proportion to how frequent the different prey are – the predator has no preference, it just goes around randomly and eats what it finds\nThe classic OG version of this model comes from Holling (1966)\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\alpha N}{1 + h\\alpha N}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere\n\nN is the number of prey\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the attack rate\n\\(h\\) is the handling time\n\nAnd altogether you get the number of attacks \\(A\\) on prey in some unit of time."
