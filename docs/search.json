    "text": "continued fractions\nContinued Fractions look like this:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{d_1 + \\frac{n_2}{d_2 + \\frac{n_3}{d_3 + \\cdots } } }\n\\]\nand have an infinite number of \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) values. However, if after \\(k\\) values you just replace the remaining ones (the \\(...\\) above) with 0, then you get a k-term finite continued fraction, which is maybe close enough:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{d_1  + \\frac{n_2}{\\ddots + \\frac{n_k}{d_k}}}\n\\]\nContinued fractions have the values of \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) defined by a series. We need a function that will take the series for the numerator and denominator, calculate \\(k\\) terms, and put them together into a continued fraction.\nSo, how do we calculate this in R? Well, it turns out we can apply two concepts we learned from Wickham’s book to do so: closures and functionals.\n\nCreating a series of closures\nWe could say that each “part” of the continued fraction was a unit that looks like\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{d + x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) are a “pair” of numerator and denominator, and \\(x\\) is the next “part”, and so on. (there are probably mathematical terms for these, but I’m an ecologist, not a mathematician!). If you “build” the continued fraction from the inside out, you’d start with \\(x = 0\\), and calculate \\(\\frac{n_k}{d_k}\\). Then you move on to \\(n_{k-1}\\); for this fraction you have the numerator-denominator pair, plus the term (\\(x\\)) which you just calculated.\nWe can use closures to calculate each of these “parts” in turn, in order to keep the numerator-denominator pairs together. Closures are functions which are created by other functions; they “enclose” the environment in which they were created (hence the name), which means they can use variables from that environment (in our case, the values of a numerator & denominator)\nFirst, we make a “function factory”, a function which creates other functions (closures which retain different values of \\(n\\) and \\(d\\)):\n\nfrac_maker &lt;- function(n, d){\n  force(n)\n  force(d)\n  function(x) n / (d + x)\n  }\n\nThis function takes a pair of numbers and defines a new function which uses them. But how can we create lots of closures, one for every numerator-denominator “pair” between 1 and \\(k\\)? We can use the function Map to run this function on each variable pair. Map works like a zipper, combining the first elements of two (or more) vectors with a function, then the second, etc. For example, the reciprocal of the Golden Ratio is the result of a continued fraction where \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) are both 1:\n\n  Ns &lt;- rep(1, 20)\n  Ds &lt;- rep(1, 20)\n  funs &lt;- Map(frac_maker, Ns, Ds)\n\nfuns is now a list of functions, each one remembering its own particular value of \\(n\\) or \\(d\\). Now all we need to do is put them together and run them all. For that, we need another functional: Reduce."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I want to tell you about an approach for functional programming in R – and then apply it to studying population growth!\nI have been studying some of the purrr functions lately. They are a useful family of functions for performing two common tasks in R: manipulating lists and altering the behaviour of functions. If you’d like a high-quality guide to this group of functions, set aside some time to work through Jenny Bryan’s excellent tutorial and Hadley Wickham’s chapter on Lists.\nI was inspired to write this post after reading This StackOverflow question by jebyrnes. He asks:\nand there is! An answerer mentioned purr::accumulate(). In this post I’m going to expand on the approach they suggest. accumulate, and its twin reduce, are examples of functionals – functions that take functions as their arguments, and manipulate their behaviour in some way. purrr::accumulate is a wrapper around to Reduce from the base package, with the argument accumulate = TRUE.\naccumulate is normally used when you want to do some cumulative function all along a vector. For example, we can reproduce the cumulative some of a vector like this (same output as cumsum(1:10))\nlibrary(purrr)\naccumulate(1:10, ~ .x + .y)\n\n [1]  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55\n.x and .y here are just a handy way of writing “the first thing” and “the second thing”. Then accumulate goes down the vector 1:10, and takes the first thing (1) adds it to the second thing (2) and so on….\nHowever, this is not the only way it works! accumulate can take an initial value (.init) and can work on a dummy variable. If its starting function does nothing but modify an element, it will just keep modifying it: so instead of f(1, 2), f(f(1, 2), 3) we get f(.init), f(f(.init)) etc:\ndummy &lt;- numeric(10)\ndummy\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\naccumulate(dummy, ~ .* 1.5, .init = 50)\n\n [1]   50.0000   75.0000  112.5000  168.7500  253.1250  379.6875  569.5312\n [8]  854.2969 1281.4453 1922.1680 2883.2520\nClearly, the 0s are not involved in any calculation (the answer would be 0!). instead, you just get the starting value multiplied by 1.5 each time!\nThis already suggests an awesome biological interpretation: logistic population growth.\npop_size &lt;- accumulate(dummy, ~ .* 1.5, .init = 50)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata_frame(time = 1:11, pop_size) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = pop_size)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line()\n\nWarning: `data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `tibble()` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ?(caption)\nOn thing I like about this is that is is to much easier to look at – it look like the common biological equation for population growth:\n\\[\nN_{t+1} = r*N_t\n\\]"

    "text": "So, is this useful?\nI wonder if this might be an interesting pedagogical tool. I feel like it might place the emphasis a bit differently to for-loops. Perhaps a for loop emphasizes the passage of time – how, at each time step (each i for example) certain things happen in a certain order (the Resource grows, the Predator kills some, then some predators die, etc). On the other hand, I feel like the functional programming approach emphasizes how a population (or pair of populations) is transformed. Each little function has some parameters – which are either, constant, varying, and/or influenced by something besides population size – and each little function does only one thing – transform the population between one time step and the next."

There are many popular ways of describing this relationship; one very common and convenient relationship is the Von-Bertanalaffy (VB) growth curve:\n\\[\nL_t = L_0e^{-rt} + L_\\infty(1 - e^{-rt})\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThis can also be written as\n\\[\nL_t = L_\\infty - (L_\\infty - L_0)e^{-rt}\n\\]\nThis curve has a long tradition in ecology. It can be derived from simple assumptions about how different aspects of metabolism scale with the body size of an organism. I’m not going to derive it here because I don’t want this to be a huge post!\nI like this second way of writing the equation because it highlights that the VB equation is a linear transformation of an exponential function. We start out at \\(L_0\\) and exponentially decay towards \\(L_\\infty\\)."

They eat prey faster when there is more prey – though they do have to slow down to catch, kill, and chew.1\nIf a predator can eat multiple things, then they might end up eating less of any one prey because they spread their kills around among all their prey. In the very simplest case, they do this in proportion to how frequent the different prey are – the predator has no preference, it just goes around randomly and eats what it finds\nThe classic OG version of this model comes from Holling (1966)\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\alpha N}{1 + h\\alpha N}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere\n\nN is the number of prey\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the attack rate\n\\(h\\) is the handling time\n\nAnd altogether you get the number of attacks \\(A\\) on prey in some unit of time."

One technique is worth noting: the types of the input vectors. Binomial distributions deal in integers, and so we define densities and attacks as integers. However, in order to vectorize our calculations, we massage the input data from an array of integers to a vector of real numbers using to_vector. This highlights an important difference between R and Stan. Stan requires careful definition of the types of data, where R is much more informal."

In this post I’m going to focus on the mechanistic how-to of fitting a nonlinear model in brms and I’ll come back to Prior Predictive checks, which I love, in another post.\nFirst we define the model, here we need to indicate what are parameters by doing a ~1 after each.

    "text": "The challenge\nStudying selection on phenotypic plasticity is challenging. First, because phenotypic plasticity is a slope – it is the change in a trait when an environmental variable changes. Secondly, because many traits of animals also cause other traits. For example, arriving later at a breeding site causes an individual to lay fewer eggs (because less food is available)."

There are two independent things here: the probability of a clutch having 0 eggs and the probability of a 0 coming from the zero-inflated binomial.\nthis zero-inflated model is quite sensitive to the prior. That’s because there are not very many zeros being inflated: in my simulation at least, failed nests are rare and success is naturally low. it would be pretty important to decide in advance if sudden nest failure (e.g. by predation) is rare or common"

    "text": "Two (or more) relationships\nIn breakpoint regression, we think that the relationship between two things can be described by two lines which alternate at a specific point.\nWhen might this happen? One case is when a rate is determined by the minimum value of two functions1. For an example, consider cars driving down a series of roads. The roads vary in their speed limit, and each car is driven by very lawful drivers who always drive precisely the speed limit\n\ntibble(x = 0:1, y = 0:1) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + \n  labs(x = \"speed limit\", y = \"Car speed\")\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some of these highways have VERY high speed limits. The cars, however, can’t keep up: eventually they hit their max speed. When that happens, the lawful drivers hold steady at the fastest speed their car can maintain. Together, you get a kind of “hockey stick” shape:\n\ntribble(~ limit, ~ max,\n        0, 0,\n        200, 200) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = limit, y = max)) + \n  geom_point(col = \"white\") + \n  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 100, lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = \"grey\") + \n  geom_label(aes(x = 10, y = 105, label = \"Max speed\")) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 2) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  labs(x = \"Speed limit\", y = \"Car speed\")\n\n\n\n\nCar speed equals the speed limit, right up to the car’s maximum velocity. Then, it doesn’t matter how high the limit is, the car has to stay at maximum speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot so fast!\nNot every car is going to go at the exact manufacturers maximum speed! When (in my imaginary example) manufacturers release a new kind of car, they test a sample of cars to measure their maximum speed. Therefore we know the max speed (with some error) for that brand of car. However, the realized max speed for any specific car in the wild will be lower than this value. This could be caused by a host of unmeasured factors, such as that particular car’s defects, the kind of care it has received, etc\n\ntribble(~ limit, ~ max,\n        0, 0,\n        200, 200) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = limit, y = max)) + \n  geom_point(col = \"white\") + \n  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 100, lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = \"grey\") + \n  geom_label(aes(x = 25, y = 105, label = \"Factory Max speed\")) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 80, lty = 2, lwd = 1, col = \"orange\") + \n  geom_label(aes(x = 25, y = 85, label = \"Actual max speed\")) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 2) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  labs(x = \"Speed limit\", y = \"Car speed\")\n\n\n\n\nCar speed equals the speed limit, right up to the car’s maximum velocity – decreased a little bit by particularities of this specific car."

    "text": "Sometimes things slow down\n\nThere are no straight lines in ecology\n\nA lot of relationships in ecology are curved lines, often because there’s a constraint on the thing we are modelling as a response variable. For example, animals might get used to a specific stimulus over repeat exposures, with the result that eventually the response time drops to 0. However, response time can never be less than 0, and so the relationship is constrained from below. Relationships can be bounded above as well. Consider how the mass of an individual organism scales with increasing resources: more food means a bigger body, but eventually that relationship will flatten out.\nIn ecology, its very common to model these nonlinear relationships by applying a transformation to the response variable and modelling the resulting relationship with a gaussian linear regression. Sometimes this works out fine. Increasingly, ecologists are trying to go beyond this with models that reflect the data-generating process more explicitly. For example, an ecologist might model growth with one of the many growth equations. However, even if we develop a nonlinear model with a non-gaussian likelihood and all the features, our colleagues will still want a comparison to the now-traditional transformed lines.\nI wanted to write some simple Stan models to fit these transformed-response models. I was curious about the specific shape of the relationship we are fitting when we use these models. I have a suspicion that these curves are often fit to data, not because the scientist wants to make this curving shape, but because it improves residual plots. Whatever the reason for their use, I find that making pictures of something really helps me to understand it. My colleagues use these models, so this post is a beginning exploration of them."

In our science, each datapoint costs dearly in money and effort – the least we can do is learn the tools to use them well!"

The model structure causes information to “flow both ways” and automatically gives us the posterior distribution that is most consistent with our data and model. From the point of view of the model, there is no difference between a missing observation and any other unknown number, like a standard deviation or average.\nI also enjoy that we are modelling an average for the independent \\(x\\) variable – and then using that parameter to center the vector before modelling! This is useful if you want to set a prior on the intercept for what the average X value should be. Normally it would be tricky to center a variable with missing data (if you don’t know all the values, how can you know their average?) but Bayes makes it effortless."
