Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")") S
```

This was a surprising error that happened while I was working in Stan tonight! It looks like it has something to do with [line endings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36725864/syntax-error-word-unexpected-expecting). I had been playing with two settings in Rstudio.

and I think they changed the line endings in a way that Stan doesn't like!
